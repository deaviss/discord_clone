# Discord clone using MERN stack

My main focus is to make it look good on the frontend, and then focus on the backend side. I don't like using stuff like firebase and I want to show my backend skills here as well.

## Currently done
- Everything is hardcoded for now
- **Everything runs locally**
- Login / Register and receiving token
- Ability to see / change / add text channels as well as voice channels
- Ability to type in text channels

## Todo

- Use some modal form to create channels instead of simple prompt
- Better styling, cursor icons for each clickable icons
- Proper login system
- Store channels and text messages on the backend
- Select, or upload an avatar icon
- Create server
- Join servers
- Create voice handler using simple-peer
- Use socket.io for text messages and voice communication
